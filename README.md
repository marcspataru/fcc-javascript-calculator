This is a certification project for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).

The project uses React, Next.js (with CSS modules) and ESLint. Out of the other certification projects, this one has very poor code quality because I simply didn't like this challenge.
